### Created by Sarah Gilbert

  

## Description 
  

##### Get your bake on at Pretty Baked Bakery! This project was put together so I could revisit my test driven development skills learned in Javascript and integrate them with a brand new language, C#! This is a console only application where the user will be greeted upon arrival and along with a message of what Pretty Baked has to offer. We love bread, so we got a lot of that! We also love pastries, however both will come with a cost. If the user chooses bread, it will cost them $5. However Pretty Baked has a screaming deal on bread at the moment, so if you buy 2 loafs, you get the 3rd one for FREE. Ya, I said it....FREE. Not feeling like bread, maybe want something a little sweeter? Try a pastry out! Heck, try 3! You'll get a steal of a deal at just $5 for 3 whole pastries. If the user just buys 1 pastry though, they will be charged $2. Now who would want to do that? 

#### GO BIG AND GET BAKED AT PRETTY BAKED BAKERY.
